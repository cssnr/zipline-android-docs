## Open to Share

Many application's don't support both Share and Open with intents.
Additionally, many applications don't offer both Share and Open when selecting files.

Zipline, however, supports both intents and allows re-sharing any file(s).

Because of this, you can open files with Zipline, then Share them to other supported apps.
