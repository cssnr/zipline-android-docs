# Uploading

You can share any media to Zipline, including files, text, and links (to shorten).

## Files

1. From any application, select any file, or multiple files.
2. Choose either Share or Open (**Zipline** supports both).
3. Select **Zipline** as the destination application.

This will open the selected file(s) in the Zipline Application where you can preview them,
verify the selection, and set options before uploading.

After uploading the URL(s) are automatically copied to the clipboard,
and if enabled, the [share dialog](../docs/settings.md#show-share-after-upload) will be shown.

## Text or URL

This works the same as Files, except you select text or links, then choose Share.

1. Select any text or click on a link in your address bar.
2. Click the Share option and select **Zipline** as the destination.
3. Verify, edit, and optionally set a Vanity for Links before uploading.

You will have the option to edit the text, link, file name, or vanity URL before proceeding.

Similar to files, the resulting URL is automatically copied to the clipboard,
and the [share dialog](../docs/settings.md#show-share-after-upload) can be enabled show automatically.

If you have any trouble using the application, [support is available](../support.md).
