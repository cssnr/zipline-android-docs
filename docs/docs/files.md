# Files Page

The Files page loads your recent files from the server.

- Loads a [configurable number](./settings.md#files-per-page) of recent files from the server.
- Loads more pages as you scroll down until the list is exhausted.
- List is cached while using the app. Pull down from the top to refresh.
- Media is cached and does not download over metered connections [unless enabled](./settings.md#load-images-on-metered-connection).
- Clicking on an item opens a preview and downloads it from the server if not cached.
