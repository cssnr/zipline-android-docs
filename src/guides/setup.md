To install the apk directly you may need to allow installation from unknown sources.
For more information see, [Release through a website](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish#publishing-website).

[![GitHub Version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/cssnr/zipline-android?style=for-the-badge&logo=android&color=34A853&label=Latest%20Version)](https://github.com/cssnr/zipline-android/releases/latest)

::: info UPDATE NOTICE
If you install the .apk directly there is no in-app update check.
Because of this [Obtainium](https://apps.obtainium.imranr.dev/redirect?r=obtainium://add/https://github.com/cssnr/zipline-android)
or [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.cssnr.zipline) is recommended.

## Login

To log in you need to enter your Zipline Server URL, Username and Password.

You can copy the URL from your web browser and remove the `/dashboard` from the end.

If you have Two-Factor enabled you will be prompted to enter a code after successful login.

::: tip NOTE
If you have any trouble setting up the application, [support is available](./support.md).
:::

You can now start [uploading](./uploading.md) files and text, and shortening URLs.
